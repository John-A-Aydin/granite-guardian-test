    "* _Hybrid Reasoning Model_: Tackle complex tasks with new hybrid reasoning model. Users can now toggle reasoning **on** or **off** (via `think` flag) to best suit their needs. \n",
    "* _Enchanced Performance_: We have made significant improvements in groundedness and function-call hallucination detection capabilities. 🚀 \n",
    "* _Updated Customization_: **'risk'** is now **'criteria'** to better fit a wide variety of use cases. 🎯 And with new *'Bring Your Own Criteria'* feature, users can provide their own custom criteria and scoring schema, giving them power to customize the results!"
